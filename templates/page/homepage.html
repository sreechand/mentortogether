 <p>Mentor Together is a Trust that aims to match urban poor children, 
    enrolled in formal education programs, to professionals, who will 
    serve as their mentors, based on shared  academic, career and 
    personal interests. We believe that mentoring can play an important 
    part in bringing about empowerment through education, as it 
    offers urban poor children the socio-economic partnerships that 
    they lack, coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. These 
    partnerships will help build self-esteem and will help broaden the 
    future life choices available to these under-served children. With 
    a mentor as a guide, we hope that our mentees will have stronger 
    academic commitment, as well as develop their IT literacy, interpersonal 
    and English language skills.</p>
